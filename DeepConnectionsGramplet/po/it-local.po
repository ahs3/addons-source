# A special remark are required by some sentences related to reports.
#
# * "%s was born on %s"
#
# In Italian, we use a tense equivalent to the English's past simple
# for living people, and the equivalent to English's present perfect
# for people who died.  Unfortunately, the program cannot distinguish
# between these two cases.
#
# * ", and was buried on %s."
#
# In Italian, the word for buried declines accordingly to its subject
# gender.
#
# * "born %(date)s in %(place)s%(endnotes)s"
#
# The same rule as for "buried" applies to born, as well.
